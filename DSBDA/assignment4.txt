import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/selva86/datasets/master/BostonHousing.csv")
data.head()
data.tail()
print("The shape of the data is: ")
data.shape
Hence, we can see that there are no NULL values
data.isnull().sum()
Define the independent and dependent variables from the dataset
X = data.iloc[:,0:13]
y = data.iloc[:,-1]
Splitting data into traing and testing dataset
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.20,random_state=42)
Shapes of the training and testing dataset
print(X_train.shape)
print(X_test.shape)
print(y_train.shape)
print(y_test.shape)
Importing LinearRegression() function
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
model = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(with_mean=False), LinearRegression())
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
